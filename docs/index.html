          Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis “The Wise”?
        </h1>

        <p class="Header-text">
          I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith
          legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so
          wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life…
          He had such a knowledge of the dark side, he could even keep the ones he
          cared about from dying.

            He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his
            power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his
            apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.
            Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.
