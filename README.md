Scale the font size of an element in proportion to its width... *in style*. ðŸ˜Ž

![Basic example](http://imgur.com/zoG8oUO.gif)

[Full demo here](https://autopaideia.github.io/flextype/).

## Features

* Simple syntax for scaling at different amounts for different widths
* Define your scaling ratios in CSS, allowing you to:
  * easily override within media queries
  * leverage whatever CSS-preprocessor variables you might be using for your site's layout and typography
* No dependencies
* Supports all modern browsers and IE9+<sup>[[see caveat for IE/Edge]](#css-custom-props-caveat)</sup>

## Install

### NPM

```bash
npm install flextype --save
```

```

## Basic usage

1. Add the class `js-flextype` to the element(s) you want to scale.

    ```html
    <div class="MyElement js-flextype">Hello</div>
    ```

2. In CSS set the percentage of the `.js-flextype` element's width you want the font size to be on the [CSS custom property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*) `--flextype`. For instance, if you want the font size to be `18px` when the element is `500px` wide and to scale linearly at that ratio, you would use the percentage `3.6%`.

    ```css
    .MyElement {
      width: 30%;
      float: left;
      /* ... */
      --flextype: 3.6%;
    }
    ```

## Advanced usage

### Alternative syntax

The ratio passed to flextype can also be expressed as a key-value pair written in JSON, where the key is an element width (in pixels) and the value is the desired corresponding font size (in pixels).

```css
.MyElement {
  /* Use valid JSON wrapped in single quotes */
  --flextype: '{ "500": 18 }';
}
```

### Multiple ratios

The font size can be made to scale at different ratios for different width-ranges, flextype will adjust the font size depending on which rules the element's width currently falls between.

```css
.MyElement {
  --flextype: '{ "500": 18, "1000": 22 }';
}
```

Given those rules we can expect that, for example, when `250px` wide `.MyElement` will have a font size of `9px` and when `750px` wide `.MyElement` will have a font size of `20px`.

### Locking

You can lock the font size in for particular width-ranges by using `+` and `-` modifiers on the width keys.

```css
.MyElement {
  --flextype: '{ "250-": 10, "500+": 18, "1000": "22" "1500+": 36 }';
}

```

The +/- modifiers will prevent the font size from scaling until the next/previous rule becomes active, respectively.

## API

Flextype also has a simple javascript interface, which for the most part you shouldn't have to interact with unless you want to do particularly custom stuff.

* Manually force elements to scale outside of the window resize event

    ```javascript
    myElement.style.width = '300px';
    flextype.flex();
    ```
* Use a custom selector instead of `.js-flextype`

    ```javascript
    const flexer = flextype(document.getElementsByClassName('ðŸ’ª'));
    // Use flexer.flex() to manually scale should you need to
    // Use flexer.destroy() to remove the resize listener and reset the font
    ```

* Execute code on an element whenever flextype finishes scaling it

    ```javascript
    myElement.addEventListener('flextype:changed', function() {
      // Cycle the hue every 12px change in font size
      const hue = ((parseFloat(this.style.fontSize) % 12) * 360) / 12;
      this.style.color = `hsl(${hue}, 100%, 50%)`;
    });
    ```

* Get the suggested font size of an element based on its CSS rules and width

    ```javascript
    flextype.getElSize(myElement);
    ```

* Set the font size based on CSS rules and width

    ```javascript
    flextype.setElSize(myElement);
    ```

* Parse a set of rules against a width programmatically

    ```javascript
    flextype.size({ '500-': 10, 1500: 20 }, 1000); // = 15
    ```


## Caveats

<a name="css-custom-props-caveat"></a>

### 1. IE/Edge support

CSS custom properties are supported in the latest versions of all the major browsers **[except IE and Edge](http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-variables)**. As a workaround flextype also accepts rules embedded in the `::before` pseudo element's content property.

```css
.MyElement::before {
  content: '3.6%';
  display: none;
}
```

You can use the [flextype PostCSS plugin](https://github.com/autopaideia/postcss-flextype) to convert your `--flextype` declarations into this format for you while Microsoft catches up.

### 2. Trigger flextype manually after javascript manipulations

The font size of any `.js-flextype` elements will be scaled immediately when flextype.js is loaded and then again whenever the window is resized. However, if you insert a new `.js-flextype` element into the DOM after flextype has already initialized, or if you resize a flextype container outside of the normal window resize event, you'll need to manually trigger the resize with:

```javascript
flextype.flex();
```

### 3. Set a width

Flextype bases the font size off the width of the `js-flextype` element. If the width of the `js-flextype` element is itself based off the font size of its content (as it is with inline elements, for example) it can't work.
